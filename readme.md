*DeepFake Detection Application - Frontend Architecture*

*Introduction:*

This document outlines the proposed frontend architecture for a deepfake detection application built using React.js, TypeScript, Material UI, React Query, Redux Toolkit, and micro-frontends.

*User Stories:*

* *As a user, I need to be able to sign up and log in.*
* *As a user, I need to be able to upload video files for analysis.*
* *As a user, I need to be able to choose between real-time and background processing.*
* *As a user, I need to see the scan results clearly, with real content distinguished from potentially manipulated content.*
* *As a user, I need to see a confidence score associated with the scan results.*

*Architecture Overview:*

The application will be built as a single-page application (SPA) using React.js. It will be divided into several micro-frontends, each responsible for a specific functionality. This approach will improve maintainability, scalability, and independent development.

*Micro-frontends:*

* *Authentication:* Handles user registration, login, and session management.
* *Video Upload:* Provides the interface for uploading video files and selecting processing options.
* *Analysis:* Responsible for communicating with the backend API to submit videos for analysis and retrieve results.
* *Results:* Displays the scan results, including whether the content is real or manipulated, along with a confidence score.

*Tech Stack:*

* *React.js:* JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* *TypeScript:* Adds static type checking to JavaScript, improving code quality and maintainability.
* *Material UI:* Open-source React library for implementing beautiful and accessible UI components.
* *React Query:* Provides a data fetching and caching library for React.
* *Redux Toolkit:* Simplifies state management with pre-built functions and utilities.

*Architecture Details:*

The authentication micro-frontend will be responsible for handling user registration, login, and session management. It will use React Query to fetch user data from the backend API. The data will be stored in Redux to maintain state across multiple pages.

The video upload micro-frontend will provide the interface for uploading video files and selecting processing options. It will use React Query to submit the video file to the backend API. The results of the analysis will be returned to the micro-frontend and displayed to the user.

The analysis micro-frontend will be responsible for communicating with the backend API to submit videos for analysis and retrieve results. It will use a REST API to communicate with the backend. The results of the analysis will be returned as JSON data.

The results micro-frontend will display the scan results, including whether the content is real or manipulated, along with a confidence score. It will use React to render the results to the user.

*Next Steps:*

* Implement the remaining micro-frontends.
* Design and implement the user interface using Material UI for a consistent and visually appealing experience.
* Integrate with the backend API for video analysis and data retrieval.
* Conduct unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.

*Additional Considerations:*

* Implement error handling and user feedback for different scenarios.
* Enhance the user interface with progress indicators for video upload and analysis.
* Consider accessibility guidelines and implement features to make the application usable for everyone.

*Conclusion:*

This proposed frontend architecture provides a solid foundation for building a robust and scalable deepfake detection application. By leveraging React.js, TypeScript, Material UI, React Query, Redux Toolkit, and micro-frontends, the application will be maintainable, scalable, and performant. The provided code samples illustrate the basic approach for implementing the core functionalities. The next steps will involve completing the implementation, integrating with the backend, and conducting thorough testing.

*Improvements:*

The following improvements can be made to the proposed architecture:

* *Use a component library for the user interface.* This will help to ensure consistency and accessibility.
* *Use a state management library for the application state.* This will help to decouple the components and make the application more maintainable.
* *Use a routing library to manage the application's navigation.* This will help to create a better user experience.
* *Use a testing library to unit and integration test the application.* This will help to ensure the quality of the application.

*Specific Changes:*

The following specific changes can be made to the code samples:

* *Use the Material UI component library for the user interface.* This will help to ensure consistency and accessibility.
* *Use the Redux state management library for the application state.* This will help to decouple the components and make the application
